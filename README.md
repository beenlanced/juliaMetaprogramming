## Project Description

I wanted to better understand the concept of `metaprogramming` in the Julia programming language. In Julia programming, `metaprogramming` refers to the ability to write code that manipulates other Julia code, treating it as data. This capability allows programs to dynamically generate, transform, and analyze their own code. This transformation is done through features like macros, which are code transformations performed during compilation, and reflection, which allows runtime introspection of code and types. 

This project delves into how to perform metaprogramming in Julia.

## Objective

This repository contains code examples, image files, IJulia notebooks and other general materials related to introducing Julia programming language's Metaprogramming, Macros, and Generated Functions. It is meant for self-learning and sharing what I have learned.

## Getting Started

You will need to install Julia and IJulia to utilize the Jupyter notebooks in this repository. Then, clone the repository and you are ready to go.

## Installation Steps

### Install Julia

You will need at least Julia version 0.6.2 or higher.

1. **juliaup**

A recommended way to install Julia is to install [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) which is a small, self-contained binary that will automatically install the latest stable Julia binary and help keep it up to date. It also supports installing and using different versions of Julia simultaneously.

Install `juliaup` by running this in your terminal:

```
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh

```

This will install the latest stable version of Julia, which can be launched from a command-line by typing `julia` as well as the `juliaup` tool. To install different Julia versions see `juliaup --help`.

2. **Downloads**
   If you want to manually download and install specific Julia versions, see the [Downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads/) page.

### Install IJulia to Use Jupyter Notebooks

Install `IJulia` using instructions [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl)

### Data Sources

No external data sources were used
