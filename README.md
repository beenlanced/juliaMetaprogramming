# intro2Metaprogramming

This repository contains code examples, image files, IJulia notebooks and other general materials related
to introducing Julia programming language's Metaprogramming, Macros, and Generated Functions.<br>

Good luck and hope the material can be of use. <br>


## Getting Started

Nothing really fancy here to mention. Just pull files as needed and run the code or
peruse the material for information purposes. <br>


### Prerequisites

You will only need access to a machines running at least Julia version 0.6.2, If you are using JuliaBox all packages and code will be setup for you. Checkout Installing section below<br>

Please go [here](https://JuliaBox.com) to log-on and use JuliaBox <br>


## Deployment

No deployment required either!

## Files and other code were built with and using:

* [ATOM](https://atom.io) - Text editor jazzed up with Juno to run Julia
* [Julia](https://julialang.org) - Julia, the high performance dynamic programming language
* [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) - Jupyter Notebook for Julia 
* **AND LOVE :-P**
